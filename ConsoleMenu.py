# This class is responsible for interacting with the family tree and printing the output to the console
# A brief breakdown of class functionality:
# This class contains a menu loop from which it asks the user for the following:
# Family member to view details
# Option to perform which calls one of the 9 methods e.g. show_parents
# If the user wants to continue or quit
