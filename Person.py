# This is the Person class which represents everyone in the family tree
# This class functions mainly a record for person, their basic details and parental relationship
# This class should not include any sidewards relationships
# Only methods that act on a singular person should be included here
# Code which operates on multiple people should be placed inside FamilyTree.py
